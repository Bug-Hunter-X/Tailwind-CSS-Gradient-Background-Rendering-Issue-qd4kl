# Tailwind CSS Gradient Background Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a Tailwind CSS gradient background may not render correctly across different browsers. The issue is likely caused by browser inconsistencies in supporting the `linear-gradient` function or conflicts with other CSS rules.

## Bug Description

A div element uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a gradient background.  However, the gradient may not display correctly or may appear distorted on certain browsers. This inconsistency leads to a suboptimal user experience across platforms.

## Solution

The solution involves using a more robust approach to handle gradient backgrounds in Tailwind CSS, ensuring consistent rendering across different browsers and preventing conflicts with existing CSS.
